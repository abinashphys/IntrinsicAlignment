# Intrinsic ALignment Analysis using the TATT model

This repository has all the essential tools for the aanalysis of the TATT model. The contents could essentially be used to create datavectors, (I have also put a full list of datavectors both for non-higher order (25newDVs) and also for the Full TATT model (Final_TATT)) calculate the $\Delta \chi^2$ values and use the plotting notebooks for visulizing them. In the plotting_notebook folder the two .csv files contain the relevant data for a quick reference of $\Delta \chi^2$ values for both shear and GGL.
